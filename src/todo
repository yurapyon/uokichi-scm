  cleanup
  error checking
    make programmer / connect to arduino
  pic stuff
  look into if x86 stuff can work

a:
  memory
  documentation facilities
    instructions / opdefs
      for idef types, just build documentation out of opdef spec-str
        just make a string and keep it in idef struct

        maybe keep everything else unprintable so instruction documentation
        is as easy as
          '> .add.idef'
          in repl

          (doc .add) where doc is some 'method' inst bad either
    registers

u+p:
  rename send_hex_file to write_hex_file
  communication
    >
      send_sync(bool failed)
      send_msg(string msg)
      send an error message before sending failed sync
      sync is a marker for whenever a task is finished
    use bytes instead of strings?
      set_chip and stuff can use enums
      faster overall for sure and better memory usage
  eeprom
  fuse/lock

p:
  check checksums
  better memory usage (global buffers and stuff)
